    text: "For this lovely client, the creation of the brand started with naming.
      After discussing and analysing the client's wishes, we found a name that
      she felt was perfect for her endeavour: Atelier Pusteblumen. Pusteblumen
      is the German name for Dandelions. The logo is a representation of her
      love for nature and there is a subtle mention about her family."
