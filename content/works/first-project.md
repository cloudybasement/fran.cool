imageAltText: This first image displays a mock-up of the visual look of the
  website on a macbook 16 inches screen as well as the mobile version of the
  website on an iPhone 11.
summary: This project was a passion project. The goal was to create a single
  page website about any present issue that needed to be known about so I
  decided to raise awareness about Cystic Fibrosis, a misunderstood medical
  condition.
modules:
  - type: paragraph
    text: The idea was to create a full identity around the disease in order to
      create awareness through recognition. Subsequently, a logo was created as
      well as a single page website with thoroughly researched information.

  - type: paragraph
    text: The logo was created trying to represent lungs and used the southern cross
      to associate the organisation with Australia. The information layout is
      very strict; what is CF, symptoms, care, treatments and
      volunteers/donating opportunities. The imagery is strictly related to the
      medical field except for the last one, for the call to action to help one
      another. The ultimate goal for this project was to create a platform that
      offers and presents valuable information in a clear and concise manner.
