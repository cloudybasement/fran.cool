      T﻿he logo for Professional Organiser Co needed to reflect their values and
      be accessible. It was all about the concept, which follows as such: 


      Home means protection and serenity. It’s an enclosed space that is familiar to only few individuals, the result of years of curation to transform room into home. It is a shelter and a refuge. People are very protective of their homes but also susceptible to how it is perceived by others. Just like humans, a home is houses constant changes through different life stages. The different floors symbolise growth and transformation, a never-ending cycle. It also shows that life can be messy but always recalibrated. With a feeling of safety but unequal transformation within, this symbol translates life into icon.


      With that, the logo was created to be transformational and strong.
